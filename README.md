# NSTD
A cross-platform, fast, and safe general purpose C library written in Rust.

The library is organized as a series of modules. The top level module `nstd` encompasses the entire
crate. Each module can have their own submodules (eg. `nstd.io.stdout` or `nstd::io::stdout` with
Rust syntax).

# Example using C
```c
// Build nstd with features set to "capi nstd_core nstd_io".
#include <assert.h>
#include <nstd.h>

/// Main entry point of the program.
int main(void) {
    const NSTDOptionalStr output_opt = nstd_core_str_from_raw_cstr("Hello, ðŸŒŽ!");
    assert(output_opt.status);
    const NSTDStr output = output_opt.value.some;
    assert(nstd_io_print_line(&output) == NSTD_IO_ERROR_NONE);
    return 0;
}
```

# Platform support
`nstd.core` should support anything that rustc supports.

`nstd.os`'s child modules will only work on the operating system they target. For example,
`nstd.os.windows` will only work on Windows and `nstd.os.unix` will only work on Unix-like systems.

Other modules will work on most platforms, primarily targeting Windows, macOS,
Linux, Android, and iOS.

# Language support
This library can be accessed from any language that supports calling C code. As of now this will
need to be done manually as there are no official wrappers for the API, however somewhere around
version 0.11, the plan is to start adding official wrappers so developers from other languages
can easily use the API.

# Safety
*Please note that these safety notes (as well as the framework as a whole) are a work in progress.*

## User safety notes

- Raw pointers are unsafe to access.

- References are assumed to be valid (aligned, non-null, and non-dangling), and are safe to access.
Users can refer to the [docs](https://docs.rs/nstd-sys/latest/nstd_sys/) to see which APIs expect
or return valid references.

- Input reference data is assumed to remain unaltered by other code/threads.

- C function pointers are assumed to be non-null unless wrapped in an `Option`.

- Private (non-`pub`) structure members must not be directly accessed by the user.

- Structured enum variants must be checked before they're accessed (eg. `NSTDOptional` or
`NSTDResult` types).

- Data is *moved* when using the value-copy semantic on a type that does not implement `Copy`.

- Data must not be moved while being referenced by another object.

- Types that do not implement the `Send` trait must not be sent between threads.

- Types that do not implement the `Sync` trait must not be shared between threads.

## Contributor safety notes

- Any operation that may cause
[undefined behavior](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/behavior-considered-undefined.html) must
be marked unsafe.

- All C function pointers taken as input by the API must be marked unsafe.

- The panic behavior is set to abort by default, as it is undefined behavior to unwind from Rust
code into foreign code (though this is
[subject to change](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2945-c-unwind-abi.html)).

# How to build
Building `nstd` as a C library requires you to specify the "crate-type" manually. To do this you
must pass a `--crate-type` of either `cdylib` or `staticlib` to rustc. Rust allows you to use this
flag multiple times in case you need both.

`nstd` lets you decide what features you want to use.

Any module that falls under the top level module has a dedicated feature flag, for example
`nstd.core` has the feature flag `nstd_core` and `nstd.alloc` has the feature flag `nstd_alloc`.

Each module may have additional features, for example `nstd.os` has the additional
`nstd_os_windows_alloc` feature for memory allocation on Windows, this allows other modules to use
the low level memory allocation API for Windows without enabling memory allocation for other
operating systems.

The `std` feature flag links the Rust standard library into the binary.

The `capi` feature flag is used to build `nstd` as a C library.

The `link` feature flag will link to an existing `nstd` library on the system. This feature is
encouraged but not required to be enabled for Rust crates that use `nstd`'s `capi` feature.

`std` and `nstd_core` are enabled by default.

Example:
```sh
cargo rustc --release --crate-type cdylib --crate-type staticlib --features "capi nstd_alloc"
```

To build with all features:
```sh
cargo rustc --release --crate-type cdylib --crate-type staticlib --all-features
```

# Installing with `cargo-c`
`nstd` also allows you to use `cargo-c` to build or install the library.

Install `cargo-c`:
```sh
cargo install cargo-c
```

Here is an example of how to build the library for a Unix machine with all features enabled:
```sh
cargo cinstall --release --all-features --destdir=./install --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib
```
This will create a new `install` directory with the installation contents.

You can now copy the contents to the root folder using `cp`:
```sh
sudo cp -a ./install/* /
```

# Releases
`nstd` versions follow the Semantic Versioning rules. Each release is given a major, minor, and
patch number that makes up that version of the library (major.minor.patch).

There have not yet been any major releases for the framework as it is not yet stable.

A new minor version is released every 6 weeks, exactly 1 week after a new minor Rust release.

Patch releases are released every so often with minor fixes and additions.

See [semver.org](https://semver.org/) to learn more about Semantic Versioning.
