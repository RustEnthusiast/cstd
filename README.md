# NSTD
A cross-platform, fast, and safe general purpose C library written in Rust.

The library is organized as a series of modules. The top level module `nstd` encompasses the entire
crate. Each module can have their own submodules (eg. `nstd.io.stdout` or `nstd::io::stdout` with
Rust syntax).

# Example using C
```c
// Build nstd with `cargo build --features "clib nstd_core nstd_io"`.
#include <nstd/core/str.h>
#include <nstd/io/io.h>

/// Main entry point of the program.
int main()
{
    const NSTDStr output = nstd_core_str_from_raw_cstr("Hello, ðŸŒŽ!");
    nstd_io_print_line(&output);
    return 0;
}
```

    - `proc` - Calling/Child process management.
    - `shared_lib` - Access symbols from loaded shared libraries.
    - `shared_ptr` - A reference counting smart pointer.
    - `string` - Dynamically sized UTF-8 encoded byte string.
    - `thread` - Thread spawning, joining, and detaching.
    - `vec` - A dynamically sized contiguous sequence of values.

# Platform support
`nstd.core` should support anything that rustc supports.

`nstd.os`'s child modules will only work on the operating system they target. For example,
`nstd.os.windows` will only work on Windows and `nstd.os.unix` will only work on Unix-like systems.

Other modules will work on most platforms, primarily targeting Windows, macOS,
Linux, Android, and iOS.

# Language support
This library can be accessed from any language that supports calling C code. As of now this will
need to be done manually as there are no official wrappers for the API, however somewhere around
version 0.11, the plan is to start adding official wrappers so developers from other languages
can easily use the API.

# User safety notes

- Raw pointers are unsafe to access.

- References are assumed to be valid (aligned, non-null, and non-dangling), and are safe to access.
Users can refer to the [docs](https://docs.rs/nstd-sys/latest/nstd_sys/) to see which APIs expect
or return valid references.

- The panic behavior is set to abort by default, as it is undefined behavior to unwind from Rust
code into foreign code (though this is
[subject to change](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2945-c-unwind-abi.html)).

# Contributor safety notes

- Any operation that may cause undefined behavior must be marked unsafe.

- Any operation that may cause data races must be marked unsafe.

- Any operation that makes a direct call on a foreign C function pointer must be marked unsafe.

# How to build
`nstd` lets you decide what features you want to use.

Any module that falls under the top level module has a dedicated feature flag, for example
`nstd.core` has the feature flag `nstd_core` and `nstd.alloc` has the feature flag `nstd_alloc`.

Each module may have additional features, for example `nstd.os` has the additional
`nstd_os_windows_alloc` feature for memory allocation on Windows, this allows other modules to use
the low level memory allocation API for Windows without enabling memory allocation for other
operating systems.

The `clib` feature flag is used to build `nstd` as a C library.

The `std` feature flag links the Rust standard library into the binary.

The `asm` feature permits the library to use assembly to optimize certain build configurations.

`std` and `nstd_core` are enabled by default.

Example:
```sh
cargo build --release --features "clib nstd_io nstd_string nstd_vec"
```

To build with all features:
```sh
cargo build --release --all-features
```
